		<h2 id = "main">Bread Recipes</h2><br>
			<p>The sweet and savory bread recipes I recommend are 
				<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/6912/orange-loaf/"> an orange loaf bread recipe,</a>
				<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230482/banana-chocolate-chip-bread/"> chocolate chip banana bread,</a> and
				<a href="https://inspiredtaste.net/19313/easy-focaccia-bread-recipe-with-herbs/"> rosemary garlic focaccia.</a>
				These recipes are very tasty and do not require many ingredients nor advanced cooking equipment.
				Leftover banana bread is great to use as a bread for French toast the next day. The focaccia bread pairs well dipped
				in marinara sauce. Some pictures of the breads baked from these recipes are shown below:

		<h2>Cake Recipes</h2><br>
			<p>Two cake flavors that I found to be very popular among my peers in college is lemon and chocolate flavored cake. As a result,
				I have attached simple recipes for both:
				<a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/lemon-cake-recipe-1913110"> lemon cake</a> and
				<a href="https://therecipecritic.com/black-forest-cake/"> black forest cake</a>. I have baked the black forest cake for
				one of my relatives birthdays, and its multiple layers were able to serve a lot of people. The cherries mixed with
				chocolate pair well together, and the fruit offsets the richness of the chocolate well. The lemon cake is more simple
				to make and still has great flavor. Some photos of the cakes are shown below:

		<h2>Cookie and Brownie Recipes</h2><br>
			<p>Two cookie recipes I recommend are 
				<a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/dark-chocolate-cranberry-biscotti/4297ea88-5c9c-4e0b-9ec7-ff8ae45779a6"> dark chocolate and cranberry biscotti </a>
				and <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/thumbprint-cookies/">thumbprint cookies with jam</a>. Both recipes do not require
				many ingredients and can be customized with other flavors and jam. Biscotti is great to dip into tea or coffee in the
				morning. A good brownie recipe is <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/peanut-butter-brownies/">peanut butter brownies.</a>
				These brownie make a great base for an ice cream sandwhich. Pictures of the bakes are shown below:

			<img src = "images/brownies.jpg" alt = "Peanut butter brownies" width="200"/>

		<h2>Breakfast Recipes</h2><br>
			<p>
				The breakfast food recipes provided that are simple and very tasty are
				<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16383/basic-crepes/"> basic crepes</a> and
				<a href="https://downshiftology.com/recipes/shakshuka/"> shakshuka.</a> For the crepes, all you need is a large pan to slightly 
				tilt when cooking to spread the batter very thin. You can add Nutella, chocolate sauce, fruits, and cinnamon to make the crepes sweet,
				or lunch meat, cheese, and spinach for a savory crepe. Shakshuka is very tasty and a great way to eat vegetables for breakfast. 
				I personally like to dip toasted bread into shakshuka. Below are some pictures of what the foods look like from the recipe:
