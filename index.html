		<h1>Cooking and Baking With Antoinette Puca</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p id="main">Hi! My name is Antoinette Puca and I'm a student at the University of Michigan. One of my hobbies is cooking, where
				I like to explore new recipes to cook on my free time. I became interested in cooking through my relatives, as 
				they've taught me how to cook different Italian foods growing up. When COVID-19 caused us all to stay at home
				in 2020, I started to explore more baking recipes and cuisines outside of Italian food. Going into college, I
				wanted to continue learning to cook new recipes. I have found recipes that take up less time during the day,
				but still are very tasty. To continue exploring my love for cooking, I am a part of the club Kid's Kitchen on campus
				where I help write recipes using simple ingredients for food we donated to families in need. I have taken a few
				cooking classes with my friends and family, and would like to take more in the future.

			<h2>Contents of Website</h2>
			<p>This website is split into different sections: tips, cooking recipes, and baking recipes. Throughout it, you will
				find images and additional advice to describe the recipes. To make this website more inclusive and incorporate
				different ideas, I also asked other college students for recommendations on their favorite foods to make. I have
				been a vegetarian, pescatarian, and diary free for parts of my life, and have included recipes for others in similar
				situations. Additionally, I asked students with certain allergies and other diets for recipes they enjoy as well. 
				Note: I am not a professional chef and still have much to learn, but I hope these recipes and tips help you explore
				the world of cooking and baking!</p>
