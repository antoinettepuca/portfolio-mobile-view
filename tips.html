			<h2 id="main">Overcoming Freezer Food & Eating Out</h2>
				<p>When talking to people that do not choose to cook their own meals, I've learned that many do not choose to cook due to limited experience and convience.
					While there are freezer meals and restuarant options for someone that chooses not to cook, using this as a sole method for eating can be very expensive
					to a consumer. Additionally, frozen meals tend to not have as many nutrients and the same level of freshness. Personally, I recommended that frozen meals
					be cooked as more of a last resort and restuarant food to be saved for more special occasions. Getting started in cooking and baking can be scary, but
					hopefully these tips and recipes help. Cooking with others can be a great way to connect, and I encourage you as a user to ask people what recipes they
					enjoy as well.

			<h2>List of Cooking & Baking Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Plan out groceries ahead of time, and don't shop for food when you're hungry!</li>
				<li>Use oven or stove to reheat food instead of microwave</li>
				<li>Prep ingredients before cooking</li>
				<li>Use better and fresher ingredients when you can</li>
				<li>Keep vegetable, bread, and meat scraps. They are great for making a stew or breadcrumbs</li>
				<li>Experiment with different recipes in the kitchen to find a flavor palate best for you!</li>
				<li>Clean your cooking equipment and workspace as you go</li>
				<li>Prep food in larger batches to last for more meals</li>
				<li>Use the freezer to store extra meat and bread</li>
				<li>Store salad greens in a resuable bag with a paper towel to keep them fresh</li>
				<li>Put a damp towel under cutting board to prevent it from sliding</li>
				<li>Save pasta water to include in sauce for more flavor</li>
				<li>When cutting garlic, smash the clove with the side of a knife for easier peeling</li>
				<li>Do NOT put grease, banana peels, or flour down the sink</li>
				<li>Do NOT use extra virgin olive oil to cook meats. It's more for flavoring</li>
				<li>Do NOT use metal utensils on a nonstick pan</li>
				<li>Do NOT flatten a burger or meat with a spatula when grilling. It takes out its flavor</li>
				<li>Do NOT use damp oven mitts when using an oven</li>
